This program depends on the following packages:
- python
- python-biopython
- python-mysqldb
- python-pyparsing
- mysql-server
Install and configure these packages before continuing.

After installing MySQL, create a database named ``hg19'', owned by the
user ``mutalyzer'':
---
cat << EOF | mysql -u root -p
  CREATE USER mutalyzer;
  CREATE DATABASE hg19;
  GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON hg19.* TO mutalyzer;
  FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
EOF
---
Then retrieve the refLink table from the UCSC website:
wget http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg19/database/refLink.sql
wget http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg19/database/refLink.txt.gz

And import the table:
---
mysql -u mutalyzer -D hg19 < refLink.sql
zcat refLink.txt.gz | mysql -u mutalyzer -D hg19 -e 'LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE "/dev/stdin" INTO TABLE refLink;'
---

Edit the file mutalyzer.conf to finish the installation.

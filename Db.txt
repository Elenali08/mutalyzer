The initial mapping table was created using the following command:
---
CREATE TABLE map
  SELECT DISTINCT acc, version, txStart, txEnd, cdsStart, cdsEnd, exonStarts, 
                  exonEnds, name2 AS geneName, chrom, strand, protAcc
    FROM gbStatus, refGene, refLink
    WHERE type = "mRNA"
    AND refGene.name = acc
    AND acc = mrnaAcc;
---

We need an axillary table for updated entries where the version numbers are
not increased.
---
CREATE TABLE map_cdsBackup
  LIKE map;
---

Mutalyzer, a HGVS variant nomenclature checker
==============================================


Documentation
-------------

See the doc/ directory for (possibly outdated) developer documentation and
presentation slides related to Mutalyzer. See http://www.mutalyzer.nl for
user documentation.


Installation
------------

See the INSTALL file for installation instructions.


Unit tests
----------

The unit tests depend on a running batch daemon, webserver, and SOAP
webservice:

    sudo /etc/init.d/mutalyzer-batchd start
    sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 start

Now run the tests with:

    MUTALYZER_ENV=test nosetests -v

Or, if you are in a hurry, skip the long-running tests with:

    MUTALYZER_ENV=test MUTALYZER_QUICK_TEST=1 nosetests -v


Release management
------------------

The current Mutalyzer version is recorded in `mutalyzer/__init__.py`. See the
comments in that file for more info of the versioning scheme.

On the event of a new release, the following is done:

    emacs mutalyzer/__init__.py

Remove `'dev'` from `__version_info__` and set `RELEASE` to `True`.

    svn commit -m 'Release 2.0.beta-11'
    svn cp https://humgenprojects.lumc.nl/svn/mutalyzer/trunk \
      https://humgenprojects.lumc.nl/svn/mutalyzer/tags/mutalyzer-2.0.beta-11 \
      -m 'Tag 2.0.beta-11'
    emacs mutalyzer/__init__.py

Set `__version_info__` to a new version ending with `'dev'` and set `RELEASE`
to `FALSE`.

    svn commit -m 'Open development for 2.0.beta-12'

Be sure to upgrade your installations to the new version as described in the
INSTALL file (e.g. `sudo python setup.py develop` for development checkouts).


Working with feature branches
-----------------------------

Some features are best developed isolated in a separate branch (a 'feature
branch') before being merged into trunk. To make it easier to switch between
branches, don't checkout the entire repository tree from its root. Instead,
checkout the branch subdirectory (or trunk) directly and use `svn switch` to
switch between them. Otherwise, you might need to update you Apache config and
run `sudo python setup.py develop` every time you switch branches.

To create the branch from current trunk:

    svn cp https://humgenprojects.lumc.nl/svn/mutalyzer/trunk \
      https://humgenprojects.lumc.nl/svn/mutalyzer/branches/my-feature-branch \
      -m 'Create my-feature-branch from trunk'

To work from this branch, switch your checkout to there:

    svn switch https://humgenprojects.lumc.nl/svn/mutalyzer/branches/my-feature-branch

To make it easier to reintegrate long-running branches, you can periodically
merge trunk into them:

    svn merge https://humgenprojects.lumc.nl/svn/mutalyzer/trunk

Use `mergeinfo` to see which revisions are already merged. You can cherry-pick
revisions to merge by using the `-c` option:

    svn mergeinfo https://humgenprojects.lumc.nl/svn/mutalyzer/trunk \
      --show-revs eligible
    svn merge -c 354 https://humgenprojects.lumc.nl/svn/mutalyzer/trunk

If you just want to mark a revision as being merged, you can use the
`--record-only` switch.

Reintegrating a branch into trunk is done from the trunk checkout:

    svn switch https://humgenprojects.lumc.nl/svn/mutalyzer/trunk
    svn merge --reintegrate --dry-run \
      https://humgenprojects.lumc.nl/svn/mutalyzer/branches/my-feature-branch
    svn rm https://humgenprojects.lumc.nl/svn/mutalyzer/branches/my-feature-branch \
      -m 'Delete refactor-mutalyzer-branch'

All `merge` operations taken an optional `--dry-run` switch. Use it to see
what would happen without having to actually applying.


Development notes
-----------------

Todo list:
- Improve the web interface design :)
- Test all uses of mkstemp().
- Use naming conventions for modules Crossmap, Db, File, GenRecord, Retriever
  and Scheduler.
- Use standard logging module, with rotating functionality. Race conditions
  on the log file are probably a problem in the current setup.
  Instead of that rotating, we could also use logrotate:
  http://serverfault.com/questions/55610/logrotate-and-open-files
- Setup continuous integration. Currently, I'm most impressed with Hudson.
  http://hudson-ci.org/
  http://www.rhonabwy.com/wp/2009/11/04/setting-up-a-python-ci-server-with-hudson/
  Or perhaps Jenkins.
  http://jenkins-ci.org/
- Migrate Javascript to JQuery.
- I think in the long run, the Output object is not really the way to go. It
  obscures the control flow. The logging part should use the standard logging
  module. The data gathering by the Output object is probably better handled
  by explicitely returning data objects from functions.
- Migrate from TAL to a more mondern and maintained Python template library,
  for example jinja.
- Develop a large test suite.
- Create a web interface url to watch the progress of a batch job.
- Create webservices for the batch jobs (steal ideas from Jeroen's DVD
  webservice).
- Use virtualenv?
- Use SQLAlchemy?
- Password for MySQL user.
- In deployment, remove old versions of Mutalyzer package?
- Check for os.path.join vulnerabilities.
- Use a standard solution for the database migrations in extras/migrations.
- Use something like Sphinx to generate development documentation from code.
- There are some problems with the batch architecture, especially that there
  cannot be multiple workers without synchronisation problems.

  Suggestion: http://celeryproject.org/
- Have a normal 404 page.
- Maintenance (and/or read-only) mode.
- Cleanup this document.
- Be more explicit in all the type of descriptions we don't currently support.

Code style guide:
- Follow PEP 8 (code) and PEP 257 (docstrings).
    http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/
    http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/
  Read the Google Python Style guide:
    http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/pyguide.html
- Use Epydoc style documentation in docstrings.
- End class and method definitions with their name as comment.
- Executables are in the bin/ directory.
- For examples, check established Python projects:
    http://code.djangoproject.com/browser/django/trunk
    http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/browser/trunk
    https://github.com/webpy/webpy
    https://github.com/mitsuhiko/jinja2
    https://bitbucket.org/mramm/tg-21/src
    http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~bzr-pqm/bzr/bzr.dev/files
    https://github.com/ask/celery
- A lot of code does not yet adhere to these points, this is an ongoing
  effort.

Obsoleted features:
- On eu.liacs.nl:
  /etc/apache2/mods-enabled/rewrite.load contains a rewrite rule that converts
  "Variant_info.php" to "Variant_info".
  When all LOVD versions are above 2.0-23, this rule can be deleted and the
  rewrite module can be disabled.
- In the Variant_info() function a substitution on error messages is
  performed.
  When all LOVD versions are above 2.0-23, this check can be deleted.

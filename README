Coding style guide:

* Follow PEP 8 (code) and PEP 257 (docstrings).
    http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/
    http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/
* Use __all__ definitions in modules.
* Executables are in the bin/ directory, e.g. like this:
    #!/usr/bin/env python
    from mutalyzer import batch_runner
    batch_runner.run()
* For examples, check established Python projects:
    http://code.djangoproject.com/browser/django/trunk
    http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/browser/trunk
    https://github.com/webpy/webpy
    https://github.com/mitsuhiko/jinja2
    https://bitbucket.org/mramm/tg-21/src


Todo:

* Redo configuration management. Probably look in /etc, ~/, current directory,
  or accept a --config command line argument or something. Look for standard
  Python ways to handle this. Store an example configuration file in the SVN
  repository.


Notes for server setup (Europium VM copy):

- Hostname aanpassen.
- Mailserver.
- Batch checker stoppen.


Obsoleted features:

  On eu.liacs.nl: /etc/apache2/mods-enabled/rewrite.load
  - This file contains a rewrite rule that converts "Variant_info.php" to
    "Variant_info".
  - When all LOVD versions are above 2.0-23, this rule can be deleted and
    the rewrite module can be disabled.

  index.py:
  - In the Variant_info() function a substitution on error messages is
    performed.
  - When all LOVD versions are above 2.0-23, this check can be deleted.

Automated migration scripts
===========================

This directory contains scripts to automate the migration of a Mutalyzer
installation to the latest version. Things that might need a migration
include:

- database schema
- database data
- configuration files
- cache
- ?

All migration scripts accept as parameters a flag 'migrate'. Running a
script without parameters just checks if the migration is needed. Running
a script with 'migrate' does the actual migration (only if needed).

Performing multiple migrations should be done in the order of their names.

Testing
=======

We use `pytest`_ for the unit tests. To run them, just type ``py.test`` from
the Mutalyzer source directory.

.. note:: The Mutalyzer package must be installed before running the unit
          tests.

Tests are `run automatically on Travis CI
<https://travis-ci.org/LUMC/mutalyzer>`_ for each pull request and push on
GitHub.

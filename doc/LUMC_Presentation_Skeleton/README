## Installation ##
#
The packages texlive-base-bin, texlive-latex-base, texlive-latex-recommended, 
texlive-latex-extra, texlive-fonts-recommended and ghostscript should be
installed.

We assume that you have a directory where you want to make your presentations,
in this directory the template directory `skel' should contain all the template
files.


## Making a new presentation ##
#
To make a new presentation, create an empty directory in the presentations
directory, let's say newpresentation. Now do:
---
cd newpresentation
sh ../skel/mkpres.sh
---

## Compiling ##
#
Edit presentation.tex..

To make a postscript file, type `make'.
For a pdf, type `make release' (this will also throw away all temporary files).
To clean everything except the ps and pdf files, type `make clean'.
To clean everything, type `make distclean' (of course the source will not be
  thrown away).

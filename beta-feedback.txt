Dear colleague,

thank you for your email and giving me the opportunity to test the new
version of mutalyzer. I found it really faster.
However I have a suggestion that could improve this new version.
The software provides a table of exon positions in the results page when
searching for intragenic variations.
Something really nice would be to map directly variant X to exon or
intron Y, such as the user could quickly know in which part of the gene
the variant is located.
In addition, I don't know if you plan some day to convert variations
provided in HGVS nomenclature into dbsnp rsld, but this would also be
helpful.

I hope that you will find these suggestions interesting.

Best regards,

david baux
